## PRD: Autonomous AI Web Application Co-Pilot

**Version:** 1.0 (based on Design Document v2 - June 2025)
**Date:** June 6, 2025

### 1. Overview

This document outlines the product requirements for the **Autonomous AI Web Application Co-Pilot**, an intelligent system designed to act as a partner in building and iteratively refining modern web applications. Leveraging a sophisticated LangGraph-based agent, the Co-Pilot will interpret natural language prompts, autonomously plan development steps, and utilize a rich toolbelt to execute those steps. Users will interact via a conversational chat interface and witness their application come to life in real-time through an integrated, in-browser live preview powered by StackBlitz WebContainers.

The core product vision is to empower users to translate ideas into functional Next.js (App Router) applications using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, with the AI handling the complexities of scaffolding, coding, debugging, and iteration. This moves beyond simple code generation to a dynamic, problem-solving development partner.

### 2. Target Audience

*   **Primary:** Individuals and small teams (e.g., entrepreneurs, designers, product managers, small business owners) who need custom web applications but may lack deep technical expertise or dedicated development resources.
*   **Secondary:** Developers looking to significantly accelerate prototyping, scaffold new projects, or get intelligent assistance with specific coding and debugging tasks within the Next.js ecosystem.

### 3. User Goals & Problems Solved

Users of the AI Co-Pilot will be able to:

*   **Transform Ideas into Working Applications:** Go from a natural language description of an application to a functional, previewable Next.js codebase without writing code manually.
*   **Rapidly Prototype & Iterate:** Quickly build and modify web application features, UI elements, and logic through conversational commands.
*   **Receive Intelligent Development Assistance:** Benefit from an AI partner that can understand code semantically (via LSP), diagnose issues from build errors or tests, and propose/apply fixes.
*   **Avoid Complex Environment Setup:** Interact with a live development server running entirely in the browser (via WebContainers), eliminating the need for local Node.js/Next.js environment configuration for previewing.
*   **Focus on Product, Not Just Code:** Delegate common development tasks (scaffolding, package installation, linting, basic debugging) to the AI, allowing users to concentrate on features and user experience.

### 4. User Flow (High-Level Interaction)

1.  **Initiation:** The user accesses the web-based AI Co-Pilot platform and provides an initial prompt describing the application they want to build (e.g., "Create a simple task management app with a list and an input field").
2.  **Agent Processing (Planning & Execution):**
    *   The prompt is sent to the backend FastAPI gateway, which forwards it to the Python LangGraph agent.
    *   The agent's LLM "brain" plans a series of steps (e.g., scaffold a Next.js project, install dependencies, create initial files, run the dev server).
    *   The agent executes these steps by invoking appropriate tools from its toolbelt (e.g., `run_shell` via MCP for `npx create-next-app`, `write_file` via MCP for specific code).
3.  **Live Preview & Streaming Feedback:**
    *   As the agent works, file changes made within its `REPO_DIR` workspace are communicated to the frontend.
    *   The frontend updates the StackBlitz WebContainer's file system.
    *   The WebContainer (running `npm run dev`) automatically rebuilds and updates the live preview iframe in the UI.
    *   Simultaneously, the agent streams its thoughts, plans, tool calls, tool results, and any diagnostics (e.g., from LSP or build errors) to the chat log in the UI using the 1-byte prefix WebSocket message schema.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:**
    *   The user reviews the live preview and the agent's chat log.
    *   The user provides further natural language prompts for changes or new features (e.g., "Add a button to mark tasks as complete," "Change the header background to blue").
5.  **Agent Re-Processing:** The agent receives the new prompt, re-plans if necessary, calls tools (e.g., `apply_patch` with an LLM-generated diff, `lsp_definition` for context, `run_shell` to install a new package), and the cycle of live preview updates and chat feedback continues.
6.  **Completion/Code Access:** Once satisfied, the user can access the final generated codebase from the agent's `REPO_DIR` (mechanism for this TBD, e.g., download zip, push to Git).

### 5. Key User-Facing Features

*   **Autonomous Project Scaffolding:**
    *   Users can describe an application, and the AI agent will autonomously initialize a complete Next.js project structure, install common dependencies, and set up basic configuration files by intelligently using shell commands (e.g., `npx create-next-app` or `npm init -y`) and file writing tools.
*   **Instant In-Browser Live Preview:**
    *   A fully interactive preview of the Next.js application runs directly in the user's browser within an iframe, powered by StackBlitz WebContainers. Changes made by the agent are reflected nearly instantly due to HMR.
*   **Conversational Code Generation & Refinement:**
    *   Users can add features, modify UI elements, change styles, update logic, and refactor code by simply chatting with the AI agent in natural language.
*   **Intelligent Debugging & Diagnostics:**
    *   The agent leverages Language Server Protocol (LSP) for deep semantic understanding of TypeScript code, allowing it to identify and help fix type errors and other code-quality issues.
    *   It can interpret errors from build processes (`npm run build`) and test runs (`npm test`) to diagnose problems and attempt automated fixes.
*   **Tool-Powered Development Actions:**
    *   The AI agent can perform a wide range of common development tasks on behalf of the user, such as reading and writing files, installing/uninstalling npm packages, running linters and formatters, and applying precise code changes via diffs.
*   **Context-Aware Assistance:**
    *   The agent utilizes vector search for broader context retrieval and LSP for specific semantic lookups, enabling it to make more informed decisions and generate more relevant code.
*   **Transparent Agent Process Logging:**
    *   The UI chat log provides a real-time stream of the agent's internal "thoughts," plans, the tools it decides to call, the arguments to those tools, and the results it receives, offering transparency into its operations.

### 6. Technology Stack (User-Relevant Summary)

*   **Generated Application:** Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
*   **Preview Environment:** In-browser via StackBlitz WebContainers.
*   **Interaction Model:** Web-based chat interface.

### 7. Non-Goals (for MVP)

*   Direct deployment of the generated application to cloud platforms (users will receive the codebase to deploy themselves).
*   Advanced UI features for managing multiple projects or user accounts within the Co-Pilot platform.
*   Visual (non-conversational) editing tools for the generated code or UI.
*   Real-time multi-user collaboration features on the same project within the Co-Pilot.
*   Agent self-hosting by end-users (the Co-Pilot platform is assumed to be a service).
*   Support for languages or frameworks beyond Next.js/TypeScript/Tailwind CSS.

### 8. Future Considerations

*   Integration with version control systems (e.g., agent can commit changes to a user's Git repository).
*   Agent learning and self-improvement capabilities (e.g., learning to use new tools or refining its prompting strategies based on outcomes).
*   Support for a wider array of tools and external service integrations.
*   More sophisticated multi-step planning and reasoning.
*   Visual editing tools to complement the conversational interface.
*   Team collaboration features.
